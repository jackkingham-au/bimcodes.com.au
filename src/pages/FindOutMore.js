            <Typography>BIMCodes is an Autodesk Revit Plugin that introduces the national construction code and Australian standard assessments for Building Information Models (BIM). This software is to assist design consultants and building certifiers to assess compliance during concept, schematic, and design development phases of any/all construction projects.</Typography>
            <Typography>The software, which is configured as an Autodesk Revit Plugin, can be utilised to assess the design from conception to final deliverable and beyond, outlining the compliance status of the proposed model both within Revit or in an exported report format.</Typography>
